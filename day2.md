Pan curses documentation https://docs.rs/pancurses/0.16.0/pancurses/

Basic pancurses usage

cargo install pancurses - downlaods and installs but then says 'specified package has no binaries'

Som C examples of how to use pancurses - ported them to rust https://github.com/aiafrasinei/pdcurses_examples, maybe should add them to the pancurses repository as examples.

NOTES: VIsual Studio code doesn't auto save, so if you edit the dependencies in the TOML then you have to save or you spend an hour debugging why it can't find the crate. If you save it then cargo run it will work. But run in VS Code doesn't still work - code runner seems to be compiling and running just the .rs file and not taking the whole project into account
